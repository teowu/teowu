- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Teo Wu (*officially Haoning Wu*), working on LMMs in [Rhymes AI](https://rhymes.ai), closely advised by [Dongxu Li](https://https://sites.google.com/view/dongxu-li/home) and [Junnan Li](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Junnan_Li2). Prior to this, I have been a PhD candidate (preparing thesis defense) in Nanyang Technological University ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, supervised by [Prof. Weisi Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html). I obtained by B.S. degree of computer science in Peking University (åŒ—äº¬å¤§å­¦).

- I am currently focusing on LMM pre-training and evaluation (video & longer context & better instruction-following). See our [**LongVideoBench**](https://longvideobench.github.io/), the first video benchmark for LMMs proven improvable given more input frames (>=256). I have also contributed to video and long-context training of **Aria** ([Model](https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Aria), [Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05993), [GitHub](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Aria)), an excellent open-source native MoE LMM with abilities matching GPT-4o-mini/Gemini-1.5-Flash in only 3.9B activated parameters.

- ðŸŒ± I have also been the lead of project [**Q-Future**: Visual Evaluation with LMMs](https://github.com/Q-Future)ðŸ“¹, on which 7 first-authored papers accepted in top conferences and journels including ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TPAMI, CVPR, ECCV and ACMMM. The flagship scorer, [**OneAlign**](https://huggingface.co/q-future/one-align) has been downloaded more than 238K times (*until Jul 25, 2024*) on HuggingFace.

- Prior to LMMs, my PhD topic was on *video quality assessment*, a traditional area trying to gauge the quality scores (and more) on videos. Among 6 papers published in that area (in ECCV, ICCV, TPAMI, *etc*), the two representative works are FAST-VQA and DOVER, which have been most-used baselines in that field.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Teo Wu (*officially Haoning Wu*), working on LMMs in [Moonshot AI](https://kimi.ai), working with [Xinyu Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jv4LCj8AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I have been a PhD candidate (preparing thesis defense) in Nanyang Technological University ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, supervised by [Prof. Weisi Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html). I obtained by B.S. degree of computer science in Peking University (åŒ—äº¬å¤§å­¦).

- I am currently focusing on LMM pre-training, long-prefill, and long-decode extensions.
- - [General LMMs]: I co-lead [Kimi-VL](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-VL), an open-source MoE LMM that is excellent at agent, long-context, with **long-thinking abilities** (`<think>blabla</think>`); and previously [Aria-Chat](https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Aria-Chat), an open-source MoE LMM optimized for multimodal everyday dialogs, matching GPT-4o on WildVision-Bench.
- - [Video LMMs]: I have designed [**LongVideoBench**](https://longvideobench.github.io/), the first video benchmark for LMMs proven improvable given more input frames (>=256); I have also led video and long-context training of **Aria** ([Model](https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Aria), [Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05993), [GitHub](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Aria)), an excellent open-source native MoE LMM with abilities matching GPT-4o-mini/Gemini-1.5-Flash in only 3.9B activated parameters.

- ðŸŒ± I have also been the lead of project [**Q-Future**: Visual Evaluation with LMMs](https://github.com/Q-Future)ðŸ“¹, on which 7 first-authored papers accepted in top conferences and journels including ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TPAMI, CVPR, ECCV and ACMMM. The flagship scorer, [**OneAlign**](https://huggingface.co/q-future/one-align) has been downloaded more than 600K times (*until April, 2025*) on HuggingFace.
